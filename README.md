# 3D Printer Rotary Cutting Add-On
A 3D printer add-on to enable rotary cutting (vinyl/tape cutting) for PCB creation or otherwise.

This project adds rotary cutting capabilities to an existing Ender 3 Pro configuration, but can be attached to other printers too. Included in this project is a detailed, step-by-step manual on how to cut copper tape for PCB fabrication using sheets of acrylic.

## Rotary cutter holder
The rotary cutter used here is the Roland Cricut cutting plotter: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32768955648.html

The holder for the cutter can be 3D printed in PLA without using supports. A layer thickness of 0.2 or 0.3mm will work.
